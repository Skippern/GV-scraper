## EFVM

[EFVM](http://vfco.brazilia.jor.br/Carros/efvm/trem-Belo-Horizonte-Vitoria.shtml) is a passenger train offering regular service between Greater Vit√≥ria (Terminal Pedro Nolasco) to Belo Horizonte.

For now the time table is hard coded, but with time I will look into automatic scraping. The train offers daily connection in both directions.
